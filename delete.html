    By utilizing technology, document preparation software, knowledgeable support staff, and a virtual office
    environment, we are able to provide legal services very efficiently. And we prefer to work on a flat fee basis,
    rather than charging by the hour, so you know the cost before you begin.

    This fee schedule is for the more common types of legal services we provide where there are not any complicating
    factors. The schedule is presented for purposes of illustration so that you have an idea of what a typical fee may

</p>
<p>
    We reserve the right to charge whatever fee we believe appropriate in your situation, which will be determined after
    our initial consultation. In any event, we believe you will discover our fees are substantially less than the fees
    charged by most attorneys. Our goal is to be sure you can afford the professional representation you need.

<h2>Need for Estate Planning</h2>
<p>
    You really do need a will and other estate planning documents to specify your intent and desires after your death.
    Although it is understandable to procrastinate, failure to adequately plan can have disastrous consequences, both
    personal as well as financial, for your family.
</p>
<p>
    If you don’t take the time to prepare your own estate plan, the State of Idaho will do it for you. So the question
    is not whether you will have an estate plan, but whether you will have an estate plan that does what you want it to
    do.
</p>
<h2>Preparing a Will</h2>
<p>
    At a minimum you need a will that provides how your assets will be distributed at your death and names a personal
    representative who will assist with the administration of your estate. The will can create a trust to hold property
    for minor children, as well naming a guardian for them.
</p>
<p>
    A will outlines your wishes about the distribution of your property after death, but a probate will still be
    required. You may want to consider the advantages of a living trust.
</p>
<h2>Creating a Living Trust</h2>
<p>
    When you create a Revocable Living Trust, you transfer ownership of your assets to the trust. You and possibly your
    spouse can act as trustee so you still have complete control. You can still buy, sell, borrow or transfer property
    in the trust. And the terms of the trust can be changed during life if you change your mind.
</p>
<p>
    The advantage is that when the assets are in the name of the trust there is no need for probate. The trust
    identifies the person who will act as successor trustee if you become incapacitated or upon your death. You can name
    a person you trust to manage and distribute the assets in the trust as you have directed in the trust agreement.
</p>
<p>
    The advantages of a living trust include:
<ul>
    <li>
        If an illness or accident leaves you incapacitated, your trustee can handle your financial affairs so there is
        no need for a court appointed conservator.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the beneficiaries of your trust are minor children, the trust can continue to hold the assets until they
        reach a more mature age.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you own real property in more than one state, you avoid the expense of having to file a probate in that
        state.
    </li>
</ul></p>

<h2>Durable Power of Attorney</h2>
<p>
    If you become incapacitated due to an illness or accident, you need a durable power of attorney. A durable power of
    attorney appoints a person you trust to act on your behalf. This person can use your funds to pay your bills, obtain
    services for your benefit and even make basic health care decisions for you. You can even create a durable power of
    attorney that will only go into effect in the event you are incapacitated. This is called a springing durable power
    of attorney. And a durable power of attorney may be revoked by you at any time, so long as you are competent to do
    so.
</p>
<h2>Health Care Power of Attorney</h2>
<p>
    You also should have a health care power of attorney, which lets you give legal authority to another person possibly
    your spouse or an adult child, to make any health care decision for you - including the use of life support - if you
    become unable to do so yourself.
</p>
<h2>Living Will</h2>
<p>
    Finally, you need a living will which lets your health care providers know the kind of life support treatment you
    would want in case of a terminal medical condition. This can save your family the agony of trying to make this
    decision for you.
