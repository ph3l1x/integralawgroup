<p>Based on our experience, it is clear that most business owners simply have no idea how to begin when they are ready to sell their business.  The process typically begins by default when they are contacted by a business broker who convinces them to list their business.   In fact, it is not uncommon for the business to be listed, a deal negotiated and a Letter of Intent signed before the business owner.s CPA and attorney are consulted.  And before the owner realizes what happened, the deal is often off track from the beginning. <br><br>

</p>
<p>This is completely understandable.  Most small business owners abhor paying professional fees.  Further, they simply have no appreciation of the complex interplay of legal, tax and financing issues that need to be properly addressed in structuring a successful deal.   <br><br></p>
