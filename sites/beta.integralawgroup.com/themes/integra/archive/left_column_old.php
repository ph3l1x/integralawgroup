		I want to thank Bruce Perry for all the hard work, advice and counseling he provided for me during the process of locating and buying a business. After thinking about the whole acquisition process, I think the smartest thing I did was to pay him a retainer to help me through the process.  I know I would never have completed the process without his help.
		Bruce Perry’s ability to keep the negotiations going when both the seller and I were ready to throw in the towel was awesome!  I would not be where I am at today without having his experience, advice and business contacts to help me through the process.
