 <p>The <a href="/project/date">date module</a> defines a highly configurable date/time field type for the content module and a date API that can be used by other applications. 
          </p>
          <h3>Date Field Types</h3>
          <p>You have a choice of creating an ISO date or a unix timestamp. If you are porting information from another application you may want to create a field using a type that matches the source data. Some advantages and disadvantages of each include:</p>
          <dl>
          <dt>Datestamp (Unix Timestamp)</dt>
          <dd>Stores the date as an integer.</dd>
          <dd>Takes up less room in the database because it\'s smaller.</dd>
          <dd>Often easier to use for date calculations because you can increase or decrease it just by adding or subtracting seconds.</dd>
          <dd>It is the format used by php date functions.</dd>
          <dd>It must be filled with a complete date -- year, month, day, hour, minute, second, so you sometimes have to arbitrarily set some of these values even if they are not applicable.</dd>
          <dt>Date (ISO Date)</dt>
          <dd>Stores the date in an ISO format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS).</dd>
          <dd>The data is in a human-readable form.</dd>
          <dd>You can use it for incomplete dates, i.e. only a year or only a year and a month, and pad the other values with zeros, so it does not appear to be any more precise than it really is.</dd>
          <dd>It is a format that is internationally-recognized, and it is used as-is on many web sites and in many applications.</dd>
          </dl>
          <h3>Date Widgets</h3>
          <p>There are several widgets to choose from to control how users can enter data for this field.</p>
          <dl>
          <dt>Text Field</dt><dd>The Text Field date widget uses the strtotime function to construct a date and will accept input allowed by the php <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.strtotime.php">strtotime function</a>. This allows the user to type a date in in many natural formats, like <strong>March 31, 1980</strong> or <strong>3/10/1980</strong> or in numeric formats like <strong>YYYY-MM-DD</strong>. 
          The strtotime function will assume date shortcuts are in American format (MM/DD/YY), and it will not work for dates prior to 1970. 
          </dd>
          <dt>Select List</dt><dd>The Select List date widget presents users with a drop-down list or textfield for each part of the date (year, month, day, hour, etc.). The whole selector is collapsed onto a single line using css (except for the timezone selector, if date-specific timezones are collected). The selector is highly configurable and will even handle years prior to 1900.</dd>
          <dt>jQuery Pop-up Calendar</dt><dd>The Javascript Pop-up Calendar is offered as an input alternative if the Date Popup module is installed. This widget can handle dates as early as 1900.
          </dl>
